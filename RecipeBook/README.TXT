USER INSTRUCTIONS:How to Use the Application
Once the application is running, you will see a text-based menu.

Seeded Data: The program starts with 2 recipes pre-loaded (a Chocolate Cake and a Greek Salad) so you can test the "List" and "Search" functions immediately.

Adding a Recipe: Select Option 1. You will be asked if the dish is Baked or Cold.

Baked Dishes ask for Oven Temp and Bake Time.

Cold Dishes ask for Chill Time.

Preparing: Select Option 5 to simulate "Cooking" the meal. This demonstrates the specific preparation steps based on the recipe type.

Scaling: Select Option 7 to change the serving size. This automatically recalculates the quantity of ingredients needed.
